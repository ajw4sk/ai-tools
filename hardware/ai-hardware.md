## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Configurations

### üîπ GPU-Based Setups

For optimal performance, especially with 70B parameter models, consider the following GPU configurations:

- **4x NVIDIA A40 GPUs**: Suitable for FP16 precision inference.
- **2x NVIDIA A100 GPUs**: Ideal for INT8 precision inference.
- **1x NVIDIA A40 GPU**: Capable of INT4 precision inference.

These configurations have been tested using platforms like RunPod, where A40 instances were available at approximately $0.35 per hour at the time of writing. [Source](https://huggingface.co/blog/abhinand/self-hosting-llama3-1-70b-affordably)

### üîπ Consumer-Grade Alternatives

For those seeking more budget-friendly options:

- **6‚Äì8x NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs**: Each with 24GB VRAM, suitable for INT4 quantized models.
- **NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPUs**: With 12GB VRAM, capable of running smaller models like LLaMA 3.1 8B.

These GPUs can often be sourced from secondary markets at reduced prices. [Source](https://theflyingbirds.in/blog/self-host-llama-3-70b-on-your-own-gpu-cluster-a-step-by-step-guide)

### üîπ CPU and RAM Recommendations

- **CPU**: High-core-count processors like AMD Ryzen Threadripper or Intel Xeon (16+ cores).
- **RAM**: At least 512GB DDR4 ECC for handling large models.
- **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD to accommodate model weights (~300GB for LLaMA 3.1 70B).
