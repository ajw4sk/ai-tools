# AI Tools Repository

This repo is a curated collection of artificial intelligence tools, resources, and research notes. This repository serves as an intelligent bookmark system and knowledge base for AI technologies, implementations, and discoveries.  

## üîó Related Repositories

This is part of a three-repository toolkit:

- **[ai-tools](.)** - AI/ML tools, models, frameworks, and research - brand new repo (so if you see any errors let me know!)
- **[dev-tools (private) ](#)** - Development tools, frameworks, and utilities to support productivity and efficiency  - needs to be "de-personalized"
- **[sec-tools (private) ](#)** - Security tools, vulnerability research, and hardening resources - same as above

## [To-Do List](todos.md)
### Up Next:
**Sunday 2025-06-15**
- Finish getting bookmarks and other sources into repo with AI-generated content summaries
- Used AI to generate a lot of content - Un-AI some of it and check it for completeness
- Add Privacy & Standards dirs with resources to ISO, NIST, EU, and other stadards, DPIA templates, toolkits, etc
- Build out content with other AI concepts/products/types RAG, Virtual Assistants, Chatbots, Agents, LCM, LAM, VLM, SLM, MLM, etc

## Model Context Protocol Quick Start

**[MCP Get Started](mcp/get-started/lets-gooooo.md)** 

Covers:
- MCP Intro
- Setup dependencies
- [MCP Server/Client Implementation Walkthrough](mcp/get-started/uv-quickstart.md) 
Contains:
- Personal recos/troubleshooting tips
- Links to MCP Resources
Expects:
- A basic but decent understanding of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude
- You can or are willing to jump on the commandline and install node.js 

## Purpose

I use raindrop.io, raycast, and safari/firefox profiles for staying organized and accessing information from different sources quickly, while still being able to maintain all windows and tabs open while research projects.  I also use raycast and macOS shortcuts for moving on from a subject when its timebox is over.  I tried using Bear notes app to handle what these repos do, but it was easier to have a checkout of this in the next directory over.  Using the filesystem MCP server you'll see from the MCP Quickstart just made it even easier.

- **Research Queue**: Bookmarked sites and tools that warrant deeper investigation
- **Knowledge Base**: Notes on tools that have been evaluated or implemented
- **Implementation Log**: Documentation of actual deployments, configurations, and lessons learned
- **Reference Library**: Quick access to AI tools and resources across different categories

I try to stick to this flow:

*Discovery ‚Üí Bookmark ‚Üí Research & Document ‚Üí Disseminate Initial Findings ‚Üí Document Feedback & Apply Others' Exp's ‚Üí Evaluate & Document ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Document (some more)*

Even with the right tools, yes, that process was still annoying and impossible to do every step each time. However, AI is changing that as we speak.  

### Learning Path Resources
If you have any info about how you do or have done these types of things, please send it my way!
1. **Start**: [MCP tutorial](mcp/get-started/lets-gooooo.md) #Add OpenAI Agent tutorial
2. **Practice**: coming soon
3. **Alternative**: when it comes to tradeoffs/pricing - coming soon
4. **Protect**: [Cybersecurity resources and information](cybersecurity)
5. **Develop**: | Setup - requirements.txt, dotfiles, coming soon | [Code](ide) |
6. **Demo**: Presentation templates to various stakeholders - coming soon
7. **Scale**: Coming soon

### Standout MCP Implementations - June 9th to June 15 2025

- **[Figma MCP](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-dev-mode-mcp-server/)** - Just released, will change development workflows
- **[HubSpot MCP](https://developers.hubspot.com/mcp)** - Game changer for sales teams
- **[AWS MCP Suite]()** - Comprehensive coordination platform
- **Slack Integration** - Enterprise-ready chat interfaces
  
Every week, I'll swap these out with some cool ones I saw that specific week

### Adding Content
Please contribute if you can! Fork the repo or send me what you've got via email to: [awippl@owasp.org](mailto:awippl@owasp.org) 

Ideas (not reqs) for your content:
1. **Documention**: 
   - Concept, Company, Tech, Tool etc. description and primary use case
   - Installation/setup instructions
   - Key features and capabilities
   - Pros/cons from evaluation
   - Implementation status and notes
2. **Link (optional)**: Update this README if doing a pull request

### Guidelines
**File Naming**
- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens
- Include version numbers for version-specific documentation
- Group related tools in subdirectories when appropriate
**Documentation** 
- Add implementation date and last updated information
- Document dependencies and requirements
- Extra points for personal experiences that could save others' time
- Note any applicable regulatory, privacy, and/or security considerations or limitations
- Include linked text in brackets followed by URL in parans for links
