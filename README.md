# AI Tools Repository

This repo is a curated collection of artificial intelligence tools, resources, and research notes. This repository serves as an intelligent bookmark system and knowledge base for AI technologies, implementations, and discoveries.  

## 🔗 Related Repositories

This is part of a three-repository toolkit:

- **[ai-tools](.)** - AI/ML tools, models, frameworks, and research - brand new repo (so if you see any errors let me know!)
- **[dev-tools (private) ](#)** - Development tools, frameworks, and utilities to support productivity and efficiency  - needs to be "de-personalized"
- **[sec-tools (private) ](#)** - Security tools, vulnerability research, and hardening resources - same as above

## 📂 Table of Contents
### 🧠 [LLM (Large Language Models)](LLM)
### ☁️ [AI Clouds](ai-clouds)
### 💻 [AI Development](ai-ide)
### 🤖 Coding Assistants
### 🔒 Cybersecurity
### 🔧 Hardware
### 🔌 MCP (Model Context Protocol) ⭐ **HOT**
### 🧪 Testing

## To-Do List
### Target Completion Date: Sunday 2025-06-15
- Finish getting bookmarks and other sources into repo with AI-generated content summaries
- Used AI to generate a lot of content - Un-AI some of it and check it for completeness
- Add Privacy & Standards dirs with resources to ISO, NIST, EU, and other stadards, DPIA templates, toolkits, etc
- Build out content with other AI concepts/products/types RAG, Virtual Assistants, Chatbots, Agents, LCM, LAM, VLM, SLM, MLM, etc
### Target Completion Date: Sunday 2025-06-22
- Add learning path resources roadmap.sh, aws/azure certs, ai programs, etc.  Target completion date: 2025-06-30
- pull all tutorial instructions from the tutorial so there's no switching back and forth.  Target completion date: 2025-06-15
- Add local LLM model info and instructions.  
- Add dotfile for all of the AI tools from this repo that can be installed by homebrew/winget and refernce them in repo where applicable. Target completion date: 2025-06-21
- Add info identifying the parts of products that are related to MCP, and maybe that's mostly MCP clients.  For example, the Cursor setting, Claude Desktop setting, Docker Desktop Catalog, etc.  Target completion date: 2

## Model Context Protocol Quick Start

**[MCP Get Started](mcp/get-started/lets-gooooo.md)** 

Covers:
- Setup UV - [UV Quick Guide](mcp/get-started/uv-quickstart.md)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) Walkthrough 
Contains:
- Personal recos/troubleshooting tips
- Links to MCP Resources
Expects:
- A basic but decent understanding of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude
- You can jump on the commandline and install node.js 

## Purpose

I use raindrop.io, raycast, and safari/firefox profiles for staying organized and accessing information from different sources quickly, while still being able to maintain all windows and tabs open while research projects.  I also use raycast and macOS shortcuts for moving on from a subject when its timebox is over.  I tried using Bear notes app to handle what these repos do, but it was easier to have a checkout of this in the next directory over.  Using the filesystem MCP server you'll see from the MCP Quickstart just made it even easier.

- **Research Queue**: Bookmarked sites and tools that warrant deeper investigation
- **Knowledge Base**: Notes on tools that have been evaluated or implemented
- **Implementation Log**: Documentation of actual deployments, configurations, and lessons learned
- **Reference Library**: Quick access to AI tools and resources across different categories

I try to stick to this flow:
*Discovery → Bookmark → Research & Document → Disseminate Initial Findings → Document Feedback & Apply Others' Exp's → Evaluate & Document → Implement → Document (some more)*
Even with the right tools, yes, that process was still annoying and impossible to do every step each time. However, AI is making this almost trivial.

### Learning Path Resources
If you have any info about how you do or have done these types of things, please send it my way!
1. **Start**: [MCP tutorial](mcp/get-started/lets-gooooo.md) #Add OpenAI Agent tutorial
2. **Practice**: coming soon
3. **Alternative**: when it comes to pricing - coming soon
4. [**Protect**](cybersecurity): Cybersecurity resources and information
5. **Develop**: | Setup - requirements.txt, dotfiles, coming soon | [Code] (ai-ide) |
6. **Demo**: Presentation templates to various stakeholders
7. **Scale**: Translate successful prototypes to production languages

### Standout MCP Implementations - June 9th to June 15 2025
- **Figma MCP** - Just released, will change development workflows
- **HubSpot MCP** - Game changer for sales teams
- **AWS MCP Suite** - Comprehensive coordination platform
